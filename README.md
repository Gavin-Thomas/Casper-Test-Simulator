- For my own prep. Feel free to use!
- Works best with Mac OS, but feel free to adjust the code to fit your operating system

DEPENDENCIES:
1. Python 3.x with tkinter installed.
2. FFmpeg installed and accessible via the system's PATH.
3. Platform-specific adjustments if you plan to run the application on operating systems other than macOS.
